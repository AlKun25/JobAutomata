## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. Time Constraints

   - Mitigation: Prioritize core features, use agile development methodologies, and conduct regular progress reviews

2. Limited Resources

   - Mitigation: Focus on essential features, leverage open-source tools where possible, and optimize resource allocation

3. User Adoption

   - Mitigation: Conduct early user testing, gather feedback, and iterate quickly based on user needs

4. AI Model Accuracy

   - Mitigation: Start with basic models, clearly communicate limitations to users, and plan for continuous improvement post-launch

5. Job Aggregator Reliability

   - Mitigation: Start with a limited number of reliable job sources, implement robust error handling, and plan for gradual expansion

6. Data Privacy Concerns
   - Mitigation: Implement strict data protection measures, obtain necessary user consents, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations
