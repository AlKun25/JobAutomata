# Job Automator High-Level Design

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Job Automator will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of development. The system will now consist of the following core components:

1. Frontend Application
2. API Gateway
3. Microservices
4. Databases
5. External Integrations
